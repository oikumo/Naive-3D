Header
42 4D	    | "BM"	ID field (42h, 4Dh)
46 00 00 00	| 70 bytes (54+16)	Size of the BMP file (54 bytes header + 16 bytes data)
00 00	    | Unused	Application specific
00 00	    | Unused	Application specific
36 00 00 00	| 54 bytes (14+40)	Offset where the pixel array (bitmap data) can be found

DIB Header
28 00 00 00	| 40 bytes	Number of bytes in the DIB header (from this point)
02 00 00 00	| 2 pixels (left to right order)	Width of the bitmap in pixels
02 00 00 00	| 2 pixels (bottom to top order)	Height of the bitmap in pixels. Positive for bottom to top pixel order.
01 00	    | 1 plane	Number of color planes being used
18 00	    | 24 bits	Number of bits per pixel
00 00 00 00	| 0	BI_RGB, no pixel array compression used
10 00 00 00	| 16 bytes	Size of the raw bitmap data (including padding)
13 0B 00 00	| 2835 pixels/metre horizontal	Print resolution of the image, 72 DPI Ã— 39.3701 inches per metre yields 2834.6472
13 0B 00 00	| 2835 pixels/metre vertical
00 00 00 00	| 0 colors	Number of colors in the palette
00 00 00 00	| 0 important colors	0 means all colors are important

Start of pixel array (bitmap data)
00 00 FF	| 0 0 255	Red, Pixel (0,1)
FF FF FF	| 255 255 255	White, Pixel (1,1)
00 00	    | 0 0	Padding for 4 byte alignment (could be a value other than zero)
FF 00 00	| 255 0 0	Blue, Pixel (0,0)
00 FF 00	| 0 255 0	Green, Pixel (1,0)
00 00	    | 0 0	Padding for 4 byte alignment (could be a value other than zero)
